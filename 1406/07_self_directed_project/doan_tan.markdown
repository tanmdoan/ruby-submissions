### Idea 1:

### Together We Help


**SELECTED**

or Volunteered *revised*

#### Pitch

In efforts to promote more volunteering within communities, this application helps the user
collaborate with their friends socially to organize group participation.

#### Description


Most people want to give back to the community and one of the best ways to do so is to volunteer
at an event that makes an impact on those around you.

How it works:

Find an event happening near you, you share it with your friends,
and get them to vote on events you want to participate in. Mean while it is encouraged that the user interacts
with their friends through the app to come to a well informed decision. Each poll extends for 14 days and ends 14 days
from the volunteering date. At this point the opportunity with the highest votes is picked and everyone receives a
notice to confirm or decline their participation.

#### Target Audience


Almost anyone can use this app however the main target would be more for students looking to build their resume
for grad school. Anyone looking to make an change in your community or someone who simply is looking
for a pass time that has a lot of meaning behind it. Finally, one who values the quality of the place they live in but need a nudge to get the the wheels to turn.
